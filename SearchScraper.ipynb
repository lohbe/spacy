A collaboration\\nbetween The Straits Times and the Singapore Police Force, the e-book appeared\\nin The Straits Times Star E-books app. Read the other crime stories here.\\n(Warning: Some content in these stories may be disturbing for some\\nindividuals.)  \\n  \\n**High-rolling hustler (2004)**\\n\\n **\"Unremarkable\" family man, who led double life as the darling of offshore\\ncasinos, cheated banks of millions**\\n\\nLiving in a Serangoon Road condominium with his wife and two teenage sons -\\nChia Teck Leng appeared to most as an unremarkable family man, with all the\\ntrappings of upper middle-class Singapore. But unbeknownst to his friends and\\nfamily, Chia secretly led a double life as a high-rolling hustler, complete\\nwith flashy cars, luxury apartments and a girlfriend half his age.\\n\\nHe was the darling of offshore casinos - gambling operators would personally\\nfly him in on private jets so he could have a flutter in their betting halls.\\n\\nTo feed and fund his gambling addiction, he swindled four foreign banks out of\\n$117 million from 1999 to 2003, using his position as the financial manager of\\nAsia Pacific Breweries (APB). The case at that time was Singapore\\'s biggest\\ninvolving commercial fraud.\\n\\nIn 2004, the then 44-year-old was sentenced to 42 years in jail by High Court\\nJudge Tay Yong Kwang - the longest for a case of commercial fraud.\\n\\n\"Bankers knocking on his door were there to meet the manâ€¦ to forge a business\\nrelationship, but the man they met was unfortunately in the business of\\nforgery,\" said Judge Tay at the sentencing.\\n\\nChia had been a compulsive gambler since at least 1994, when he was a\\nfinancial controller with Swire Pacific Offshore, a marine services company.\\n\\nHe had plunged deep into debt during 1995 to 1996 and owed several banks about\\n$100,000 in the form of overdrafts and credit card dues. But fortune smiled on\\nhim the next year when he began visiting Star Cruise ships almost every\\nfortnight, to try his luck at the gambling tables.\\n\\nHe won on several occasions and was offered a credit line of $75,000. In less\\nthan a year, his winnings grew to about $1 million.\\n\\nHowever, the tides turned in August 1998. In a gambling spree that lasted a\\nfortnight, he not only lost all his previous winnings, but racked up new debts\\nas well.\\n\\nBy the time he joined APB in 1999, the debts had mounted sky-high, and he was\\na desperate man. He trained his sights on four foreign banks, one after the\\nother - Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking\\nCorporation (SMBC), the Mizuho Corporate Bank and the Bayerische Hypo-und\\nVereinsbank Aktiengesellschaft (HVB).\\n\\nSubmitting forged documents, he was able to open accounts in APB\\'s name, with\\nhimself as the sole signatory. With SEB he had a credit facility for $500,000\\n- which he intended to use for himself.\\n\\nMeanwhile, APB had no idea of what its finance manager was doing behind its\\nback. Chia remained in sole control of all these accounts by forging director\\nboard resolutions that authorised him to receive the credit and loan\\nfacilities provided, sign all transactions and operate the bank accounts on\\nbehalf of APB.\\n\\nTo forge the signatures of the various directors of APB, he obtained specimens\\nfrom annual reports and internal documents. He practised the signatures till\\nhe was sure they would pass muster.\\n\\nChia\\'s modus operandi was to draw money from SMBC, Mizuho and HVB, and\\ntransfer it to the SEB account. From there, the money was siphoned into his\\ntwo personal accounts with DBS before it was remitted to casinos in Australia,\\nBritain, Hong Kong, Malaysia and the Philippines.\\n\\nHe rolled over funds provided by the banks, making timely deposits to each\\naccount whenever repayments were due, thus creating the impression of a\\ncredit-worthy customer.\\n\\nDuring a crunch situation in November 1999, he even withdrew $53 million from\\nan APB account with OCBC. He managed to replace the entire amount by October\\n2002, escaping detection. As the amount of illegal money available increased,\\nso did the stakes for which Chia gambled.\\n\\nIn 2002, he met his girlfriend, Chinese national Li Jin, 22, on one of his\\ngambling trips onboard a cruise ship. Li was a croupier in the VVIP (Very Very\\nImportant Person) room.\\n\\nHe won $1 million from her and, from then on, she became his \"good luck\\ncharm\". To make sure his luck continued rolling in, he spared no expense. Chia\\npurchased a $530,000 apartment in Grange Road for her and bought her branded\\ngoods and jewellery.\\n\\nHe also bought a $10,000 forged passport so Li could enter Singapore easily.\\nShe used it twice - in 2002 and 2003 - and was jailed six months for the\\noffence.\\n\\nBut as the adage goes, the casino always wins and the Commercial Affairs\\nDepartment got wind of Chia\\'s activities. He was arrested on Sept 2, 2003.\\nBefore his four-year run ended, he had withdrawn $117.1 million. Of this, only\\n$34.8 million was recovered. The authorities estimated that he lost $62\\nmillion feeding his gambling habit.\\n\\nWhile he was in jail, Chia wrote a 13-page paper as a form of penance. Called\\n\"Taming the Casino Dragon\", he shared his experience as an insider to the\\nworld of high rollers.\\n\\nSelf-deprecating at times, and hoping others would not make the same mistakes\\nhe did, he wrote that \"like an inexperienced teenager succumbing to the lure\\nof a newly discovered vice, I was soon hooked\".\\n\\n **CHIA\\'S DOUBLE LIFE**\\n\\nAccountancy graduate Chia Teck Leng began his career at accounting firm Arthur\\nAndersen before taking on a host of high-flying positions, including assistant\\nvice-president at UOB, before becoming finance manager at Asia Pacific\\nBreweries on Jan 20, 1999, with an annual salary of between $200,000 and\\n$300,000.\\n\\nTo colleagues, his wife and two teenage children, he was a hard-working\\nexecutive and an unassuming family man. But behind that veneer, was a high-\\nrolling casino gambler with a mistress and a \"hedonistic\" lifestyle.\\n\\nHe had been gambling since 1994. Since July 2000, he had been flying in\\nprivate chartered jets to Melbourne where he would gamble at the Crown Casino.\\nHe was given VIP treatment, staying in its most expensive room, complete with\\nbutler service. A night there cost A$25,000.\\n\\nHe was also a regular at London Ritz\\'s Club, where he could gamble even higher\\nstakes.\\n\\nFrom $200 bets during his Star Cruise days, he went up to single bets of\\nA$20,000 and 25,000 in British ones. He even played for A$400,000 a hand at\\nthe Crown Casino.\\n\\nHe met his mistress, Chinese national Li Jin, in April 2002 at the casino on\\nboard a cruise ship. She was then a croupier.\\n\\nHe won $1 million from her that night. From then on, he would ask to gamble\\nagainst her - his \"good luck\" charm.\\n\\nSuch were the losses suffered that she was eventually given a day off whenever\\nhe came on board. The Nanjing University graduate later left her job to be\\nwith Chia in Singapore.\\n\\nHe got her a forged passport for $10,000, under the name Chu Chiao-Ling, to\\nenter and leave the country. He spent lavishly. He bought a $150,000 Mercedes-\\nBenz, a $530,000 apartment in Grange Road, and gave gifts totalling $300,000\\nto various people, including his girlfriend.\\n\\n _Chia owned two apartments at Grange Tower and St Francis Lodge. Photo: ST_\\n\\n **BANK\\'S CLAIMS**\\n\\nBayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank (HVB), Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB),\\nSumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and Fuji Bank, now known as the Mizuho\\nBank, sued Asia Pacific Breweries seeking repayment for the fraud committed by\\nits employee Chia Teck Leng.\\n\\nFirst Mizuho withdrew its suit, then Sumitomo\\'s was dismissed. This was\\nfollowed by HVB and SEB\\'s cases also being dismissed.\\n\\nJustice Belinda Ang, in her judgment against HVB and SEB, said that the banks\\nhad made themselves \"easy prey\" by ignoring their own banking procedures and\\nfailing to notice discrepancies or irregularities in documents that were\\n\"staring bank officers in the face\".\\n\\nThe banks were so eager to do business with APB that they willingly gave out\\nloans of millions of dollars without doing due diligence to verify that Chia\\nwas authorised to act for the company, she said.  \\n  \\n\\n[![](http://www.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/RevampedSTLogo4.jpg)](http://www.straitstimes.com)  \\n _This article was first published on May 16, 2016.  \\nGet a copy of The Straits Times or go to\\n[straitstimes.com](http://www.straitstimes.com) for more stories._\\n\\n'}\n"
